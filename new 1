I picked notepad++
here is the tutorial
https://turbofuture.com/computers/A-Complete-Beginners-Guide-to-Notepad
it covered installing notepad++, setting up the initial settings ( default diredtory, auto completion, and default language),
keyboard shortcuts, browsing shortcuts, and the search and replace fuctions. it also briefly went over plugins and macros.

i chose git
here is the tutorial
http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
it covered creating new repositories, creating a working copy of that repository, workflow, adding and commiting, pushing 
changes, branching, merging, tagging, the log, replacing local changes, a few other useful tips and other links and resources
