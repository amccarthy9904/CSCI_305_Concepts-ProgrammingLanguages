<p I picked notepad++<br>
Here is the tutorial<br>
https://turbofuture.com/computers/A-Complete-Beginners-Guide-to-Notepad <br>
It covered installing notepad++, setting up the initial settings ( default diredtory, auto completion, and default language),<br>
keyboard shortcuts, browsing shortcuts, and the search and replace fuctions. it also briefly went over plugins and macros. <br>

I chose git<br>
here is the tutorial<br>
http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/<br>
It covered creating new repositories, creating a working copy of that repository, workflow, adding and commiting, pushing <br>
changes, branching, merging, tagging, the log, replacing local changes, a few other useful tips and other links and resources<br>

I would like to know how to use macros better in notepad++<br>
aI would like to know how remote branching works in git<br>
2<br>
I would give them more informative names > <br>
